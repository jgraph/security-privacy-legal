# Data

### Does diagrams.net store diagram data?

diagrams.net does not store diagram data at any time. Nor does it store any Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

### What kind of data does diagrams.net process and for what purpose?

There is temporary storage of requests sent to the server that serves the web application. These logs contain information such as what resource was requested, the user agent of the browser. They do not contain the IP address of the request, that is filtered out at the CDN.

The logs do not contain diagram data or personally identifiable information.

### Does the data processed include Personally Identifiable Information (PII)?

No

### Are my diagrams ever sent to diagrams.net servers?

In general operation creating and editing diagrams, no. There are some functions where diagrams are sent to diagrams.net servers:

1) Image generation when using Internet Explorer 11. Workaround: Do not use IE 11
2) PDF generation. Workaround: Use built-in print to PDF functionality, available in Chrome, MacOS, Linux and Windows 10+.
3) For importing binary format .vsd files. Workaround: Use the native Microsoft tool to open the vsd and re-save as .vsdx. diagrams.net processes these client-side, no data is sent out.
4) For creating PlantUML diagrams. No workaround, only solution is to not use the PlantUML functionality built-in.

### Is cloud data encrypted?

diagrams.net does not store anything at rest, data or PII. Data is always encrypted between all nodes in transit.

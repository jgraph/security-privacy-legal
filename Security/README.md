### diagrams.net/draw.io Security

Contained are the master copies of draw.io security documentation. This includes security policy documentation, Q&A of security reviews for SaaS security compliance and penetration test reports and reponses.

This documentation was created as the result of users asking for us to fill in security audits. The idea is to generate a knowledge base complete enough such that you can that this information and will be able to fill in those audits.

In 2018 diagrams.net went through Google's internal security audit for use with Google Drive and passed. Unfortunately, we have not been able to obtain permission to publish the details of the audit. If you are a paying GSuite user, you might wish to try asking Google for a copy.

### Security/Penetration Testing

From May 2020 we have active program(s) on [Bugcrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/). We've found this continous testing process spread across a large number of security researchers to be much more effective . Therefore, the 2020 penetration test report is the last in that format.

### Change process

If you would like a change to a security policy or wish specific questions to be asked in the security FAQ, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/jgraph/security-privacy-legal/issues). You are free to propose any changes, but smaller, well explained additions and changes are more likely to be taken for review.

Change requests must be limited to improvements to the public content in this repository. We will not fill in your security review for free products.

If your request relates to a paid product within the Atlassian ecosystem, you can either submit an issue on this project, or email support@draw.io.
